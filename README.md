For Sunway Part 2 Assessment from candidate Dana

Please note:
This is made with minimal knowledge of Spring Boot Framework. 

Initially wanted to do it with Java Swing GUI which I have experience with, however, I feel the frontend display will look outdated and will take too long to connect to the chosen databse I want.

I apologize if the clothes doesn't look too clean or optimize according to Part 2 of the IT assessment. 

todo:
Clean up codes/optimization
