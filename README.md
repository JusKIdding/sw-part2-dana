# Sunway Part 2 Asessment - Spring Boot Framework 
For Sunway Part 2 Asessment from candidate Dana

Please note:
This is made with minimal knowledge of Spring Boot Framework and developing BE from scratch. Only have experience in maintaining FE and BE. 

I apologize if the clothes doesn't look too clean or optimize according to Part 2 of the IT assessment. 


Missing validation:
__FE__
1) DOB [Registration User Page]

Missing connection for FE to BE (due to lack of understanding despite successfully managed to test BE with Spring Boot framework)
Therefore, unable to INSERT and UPDATE as according to Part 2 assessment.

2) Get more practice on development side for FE to BE connection
